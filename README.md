      ## Rationale
      # Architecture Rationale

## Chosen Cloud-Native Patterns and Components
We propose a microservices architecture decomposed from the existing monolithic application. Each functional area (e.g., transactions, reporting) is encapsulated in individual services, allowing independent scaling and deployment. The use of an API Gateway will control access and route requests, while a monitoring service will provide observability features.

## Technology Decisions and Justification
1. **Microservices**: Decomposing the application into services allows for targeted improvements, scalability, and independent deployments.
2. **AWS RDS**: Using a managed database service alleviates maintenance overhead.
3. **Elastic Container Service (ECS)**: Provides a flexible and scalable environment for deploying microservices.
4. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Streamlines deployment processes to ensure faster delivery of features.

## Benefits
- **Scalability**: Each microservice can scale independently based on demand, addressing performance bottlenecks.
- **Cost-Effective**: Utilizes a pay-as-you-go model of AWS services, optimizing resource usage.
- **Security**: The integration of IAM roles and security groups enhances data protection.
- **Resilience**: Distributing the application across various services improves fault tolerance and availability.

## Alignment with Industry Context
The financial services sector demands high reliability, compliance, and the ability to adapt to changing regulations. This cloud-native architecture not only fulfills those requirements but also modernizes the underlying technology, enabling better customer experiences and operational efficiencies.

      ## Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
      # Architectural Decision Record

## Problem(s) to Solve
1. Performance and Scalability issues of a monolithic COBOL application.
2. Lack of modern observability and monitoring tools.
3. High maintenance costs tied to an aging codebase.
4. Difficult integration with new technologies due to lack of APIs.

## Analysis Performed
- Evaluated existing application architecture characteristics and identified critical areas of improvement.
- Reviewed cloud-native architecture patterns and best practices for the finance industry.
- Assessed managed services to reduce overhead and improve performance.

## Decision and Justification
The decision is to transition to a microservices architecture deployed on AWS. This new architecture will utilize services like ECS for container management, RDS for database management, and established CI/CD practices to streamline development. This approach addresses performance and scalability concerns, enables real-time observability, and reduces the reliance on scarce development resources.
